**Apocalypse Calculus** is an infinite, gamified math and physics trainer designed as a **brain stimulator** (inspired by *Axones*‚Äîthe ancient neural training grounds of the mind). Built for **agentic work**‚Äîempowering AI agents, developers, and autonomous systems to sharpen computational reasoning, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning‚Äîthis web app turns mental math into an endless apocalypse of challenges. Survive waves of derivatives, quantum equations, and non-Euclidean geometry while leveling up your cognitive arsenal.

Whether you're an AI agent training for real-time decision-making, a developer prototyping agentic workflows, or a human user pushing mental limits, Apocalypse Calculus auto-adapts difficulty, provides hints, and teaches through failure. No boredom, just infinite progression.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (with animations/transitions), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Math Rendering**: [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for LaTeX-style equations.
- **Deployment**: Single-file HTML‚Äîhost anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
- **No Backend**: Pure client-side for instant, agentic execution.
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kvnbbg/apocalypseCalculus.git
   cd apocalypseCalculus
   ```

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no server needed!).
   - Or serve with a local server:
     ```
     npx serve .  # or python -m http.server 8000
     ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages.
   - Or drag `index.html` to any static host.

4. **Customize for Agentic Work**:
   - Edit the `operations` array in `<script>` to add domain-specific challenges (e.g., graph theory for AI pathfinding).
   - Integrate with agents: Use `getRandomOperation()` as a callable function for scripted training.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Humans (Brain Training)
- Load the page and start solving challenges in the input field.
- Submit manually or let auto-mode teach you after 30s.
- Build streaks to unlock harder levels‚Äîaim for 100+!

### For AI Agents & Developers
- **Training Loop**: Script fetches challenges via DOM manipulation or export `getRandomOperation()` for headless runs.
- **Evaluation**: Compare agent outputs against `result` for reinforcement learning.
- **Example Agentic Snippet** (JavaScript):
  ```js
  // Pseudo-code for agent integration
  const challenge = getRandomOperation();
  const agentGuess = yourAgent.solve(challenge.expr); // Your AI logic here
  const isCorrect = agentGuess === challenge.result;
  if (isCorrect) streak++; else learnFromMistake(challenge);
  ```
- Extend with Web Workers for parallel simulations.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Enter`: Submit answer.
- `H`: Toggle hint.

## Issues

### Issue 1: [Bug] Derivative Generator Produces Invalid Polynomial Strings for Degree 0 Constants
**#1 opened on Oct 17, 2025 by kvnbbg**

**Description**:  
When generating derivatives for constant polynomials (e.g., \( f(x) = 5 \)), the output string is `'0'` but the TeX rendering fails to wrap it properly, showing raw text instead of \( 0 \). This breaks immersion in agentic training loops where symbolic output is parsed.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Level up to trigger a high-degree poly that rolls a constant.
2. Observe `resultTex` in console: `'0'` without KaTeX delimiters.

**Expected Behavior**: Render as \( 0 \).  
**Impact**: Low (rare), but affects symbolic AI integrations.  
**Priority**: Medium.  
**Labels**: bug, calculus, rendering.

### Issue 2: [Enhancement] Add Integral Operations for Balanced Calculus Coverage
**#2 opened on Oct 17, 2025 by kvnbbg**

**Description**:  
Derivatives are covered, but no antiderivatives/integrals. For agentic work in optimization (e.g., RL reward integrals), add basic indefinite integrals for polynomials and trig functions.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Extend `operations` array with an integral generator using SymPy.js or manual rules.
- Example: \(\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C\).

**Benefits**: Completes calculus suite; useful for physics sim agents.  
**Difficulty**: Medium (symbolic math).  
**Priority**: High.  
**Labels**: enhancement, calculus, agentic.

### Issue 3: [Feature] Expose RESTful API for Headless Agentic Integration
**#3 opened on Oct 17, 2025 by kvnbbg**

**Description**:  
Current app is UI-only; for true agentic workflows (e.g., LangChain agents or autonomous bots), provide a simple API to fetch challenges/results without browser.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add `api.js` with endpoints like `/challenge?level=5&topic=quantum`.
- Use Express.js mini-server (or serverless via Vercel).
- Auth via API key for rate-limiting.

**Use Case**: Integrate into AI pipelines for dynamic math-based decision trees.  
**Difficulty**: High (new backend).  
**Priority**: High.  
**Labels**: feature, api, agentic.
